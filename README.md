# Diaspora Concierge Hub 

A multilingual web application for the Ethiopian diaspora to book essential travel, property, and business services in Ethiopia. Built as a Virginia Tech Capstone project in partnership with Eleos Groups.

##  Project Summary

The Diaspora Concierge Hub is a web-based service platform that connects members of the Ethiopian diaspora with trusted travel and property services in Ethiopia. The app allows users to register, submit service requests (e.g., airport pickup, lodging, office rental), plan their trips, estimate costs, and complete payments online â€” all within a multilingual (English/Amharic) interface. An admin dashboard provides backend access to manage requests and service content.

Built with React, Vite and Supabase (Database + Auth) and is focused on supporting diaspora users with seamless access to reliable resources in Ethiopia.
